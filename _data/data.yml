    title: My Background
    summary: |
    
      I have been tutoring since I was 15 years old. I started tutoring incoming high school freshman and sophomores when I was a sophomore in high school, and that is also when I started tutoring for the SAT. I have perfect scores on both the old SAT and the new SAT. I scored 4+ on 11 AP's, and 750+ on 8 SAT subject tests. This allowed me to tutor college courses even as a freshman at NYU. I continued to tutor throughout college and after. I also scored in the 100th percentile on the MCAT, LSAT, and other graduate level standardized tests.


      My gift is being able to connect with my student and explaining the lesson in a way that fits into his or her reality. Students tend to be averse to things that are not fun. I make learning fun.

      Frankly, I just love teaching. I find that it is the best way to learn.

  title: Why Choose Me?
  summary: |
   For my students I custom-tailor a curriculum based on my own scientific research into the nature of learning. I use a combination of excel including Gantt charts, spaced-repetition, critical thinking, and Socratic questioning.

  The two most important lessons for my students are : 
    -1. Tolerance of Uncertainty; 
    -2. Confidence in your own self-efficacy. 
  Anyone can attain mastery. I never doubt. Anything can be learned. Simply breathe, accept that you are a beginner, let go of ego, and trust the process.
  Learn how to learn. That is my secret, and my teaching philosophy.

          - "Adnan was a very strong tutor. He was able to help me correct some misconceptions I had with regards to the Principle Quantum Theory, Thermodynamics, and Periodic Trends. The homework assignment that he created for me was excellent, and very much on par with what I needed additional practice in. It was evident that he put a significant amount of thought and time into creating the assignment for me, and was there to help with some of the more challenging questions. " Brian Volpe, 7/28/2018
